are going on, and there are two candidates A and B, contesting with each other. There is a queue of voters and in this queue, some of them are supporters of A and some of them are supporters of B. Many of them are neutral. The fate of the election will be decided on which side the neutral voters vote. Supporters of A and supporters of B make attempts to win the votes of neutral voters.</h4>\\n\\n<h4 id=\"the-way-this-can-be-done-is-explained-below\">The way this can be done is explained below:</h4>\\n\\n<pre><code>1. The voter queue is denoted by three characters, viz {-, A, B}. The ‘-’ denotes neutral candidate, ‘A’ denotes supporter of candidate A and ‘B’ denotes supporter of candidate B.\\n2. Supporters of A can only move towards the left side of the queue.\\n3. Supporters of B can only move towards the right side of the queue.\\n4. Since time is critical, supporters of both A and B will move simultaneously.\\n5. They both will try and influence the neutral voters by moving in their direction in the queue. If a supporter of A reaches the neutral voter before a supporter of B reaches him, then that neutral voter will become a supporter of candidate A.\\n6. Similarly, if a supporter of B reaches the neutral voter before supporter of A reaches him, then that neutral voter will become a supporter of candidate B.\\n7. Finally, if both reach at the same time, the voter will remain neutral. A neutral vote cannot decide the outcome of the election.\\n8. If finally, the queue has more votes for candidate A, then A wins the election. If B has more votes, then B wins that election. If both have equal votes, then it will be a coalition government.\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<h4 id=\"your-task-is-to-find-the-outcome-of-the-election\">Your task is to find the outcome of the election.</h4>\\n\\n<h5 id=\"for-example\">For Example:</h5>\\n\\n<pre><code>Given string- “B--A-”\\n              B --->  B  A   <--- A    B\\n              ----------------------------->\\nOutput - B as B can move towards right only and A can move in left direction only. Thus B has 3 supporters in total while A have only 2 supporters. \\n</code></pre>\\n\\n<h4 id=\"note\">Note:</h4>\\n\\n<pre><code>1. There are no test cases where all votes are neutral.\\n2.

Salary and Appraisals: Many employees feel that the compensation is lower compared to industry standards, especially for freshers or those in junior roles. Increment percentages are often perceived as modest.\\n2. Limited Growth for Niche Skills: Some employees express concerns about the lack of opportunities to work on cutting-edge technologies or niche skills due to the nature of the projects.\\n3. Work-Life Balance: Depending on the project and client demands, maintaining work-life balance can be challenging. Long hours or high workloads may arise during critical phases.\\n4. Bureaucracy and Hierarchy: As a large organization, decision-making processes might feel slow and overly hierarchical to some employees.\\n5. Onsite Opportunities: The allocation of onsite roles can be highly competitive and dependent on project requirements, leading to dissatisfaction among those seeking international exposure.\\n6. Skill Utilization: Employees sometimes report being allocated to roles or projects that do not match their skill set, leading to stagnation or lack of job satisfaction.\\n7. Training Quality: While TCS offers extensive training programs, some employees feel these are too generic or insufficiently aligned with the latest industry trends.\\nThese issues aren't universal and vary greatly depending on the individual, the team, and the project.
